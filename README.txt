Instructions: 

After we start up our server, it will generate a host name. Copy the host name. Next, start up the client. The client will ask for the host name. Paste the copied host name into this section and click enter. On the server side, it will ask which file we want to transfer. There are two files available to send, Krabby.jpg and Bikini_Bottom.jpg. Type in one of those file names in order to start the file transfer. 

A file transfer complete output will be generated when the file has been received fully. The transferred file will be in the ‘rec’ folder.
